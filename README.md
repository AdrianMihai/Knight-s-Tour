## Knight's Tour
This is a python application that solves the knight's tour problem using an evolutionary algorithm.

## Solution condition
An individual is considered a knight and its chromosomes represent the moves it makes on the chess board.
The fitness of an individual is equal to the number of valid moves performed (in the L shape), therefore
a solution is found when the fitness reaches a value of 63.
